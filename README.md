Thursday 22/07/2021. Presentation day yo

Before dry runs, order of presentation:

1. Roleplay: Kris & Koko
2. Intro: Kris
3. Demo & technical stuff: Rodrigo
4. Retro, talk about techinical stuff as well. Kritika talks about what I haven't talked about
    Challenges: Zac
    Positive: Kritika
5. EDA Reflection: Koko

Zac's prep, challenges as a team:
- First of all had a big MVP 
    - Meant the stretches weren't so many
    - Overwork, burnt out
- Too much work
    - Lack of sleep
- Snacks
- On the backend, component file structure
- auth0 
- Styling
    - classNames
    - background
- Image uploader
- File conflicts - bundle.* , styling, dev.sqlite3
- Deployment. This actually deploys automatically to online whenever we made changes and pushed online, but as the project went on there were more and more things to fix and so right now the online website is not

Prsentation:
Image upload in public folder

Feedback:
Prue:
Just under 10 mins. Kris 1 min
Rodrigo: 3 mins 10
Zac: 3mins 12
Kritika: 1.55
Koko: 2mins left

Cut down process(Zac's part)
Just generally Zac to be shorter

Lache:
Kris good intro. Welcome whanau.
Rodrigo: one person demo, one person roleplay demo, talking at the same time? Turn up the act
General: make sure you have image in the folder. have the folder ready to open. Make sure to remove cache.
Forms - having to fill out do it asap. Prepopulated? or opened on second tab

Other than that,
Zac: project more to the back of the room.
Jargon expalnation. Backend, MVP, Heroku, Auth0. A new techinical term, one-liner explanation.
Don might explain techinical terms before the presentation

Cleaning up what I'm saying, talk about the things that might have gone wrong, and then talk about the roles. So.. seperate sections

Kritika's reflection kinda overlapped with Zac's one.

Kritika: loved points. Both borught in good anectodes (high fives etc.. not saying Agile practice etc).

Don:
Kris - solid intro.
Rodrigo: demo.. to be checked again on the afternoon dry run.
Make sure browser history is clean, when popping out on form. 
Zac: challenges Refine it more. only 3-4 things. say stretches was not relevant.
Filesystem jargon.. confusing.
Don't talk about what app doesn't work. - rDORIGO AS WELL
Just talk about what's next.
Kritika: try not to use for notes. If you have to its fine, but
    Don loved the points, trust, gratitude etc were fantastic.
What we'd do differetnly. Seemed like an overlap, so need to check

NOTES FOR ALL THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT
Quick role play: Koko and Kris in their chef shirts / aprons.

Intro & Demo by Kris. Statistics on global food waste, also NZ.

Styling
Components
Functionality
MVP - what we wnanted dto achieve, did achieve, couldn't achieve
Telling people no negative things such as bugs, only if they ask.


Positive
Negative
Takeaways?

Talk about role. We want it to be a 'we' thing
Experience as a whole in EDA. - not necessary.
How did we make decisions?
Any issues/conflicts? What went wrong, what went right? 
What did we learn?

Don't say 'we wanted to a put a button here...'
But say we reliased our MVP was too big and had to reduce it

2. Roles and learning.

Koko - what we have felt, how we have achieved over the last month etc.

1. roleplay
2. intro to context, demo
3. overall epxerinec as a team
4. overal expeirnece as a course
5. One thing that we learnt as a group

We spend tiem reflecting tonight to prepare for tomorrow

- Form styling improvement, add responsiveness
- Stretch Edit item. Need to create component + form
- Address input form - ADDRESSFINDER (but only for one line, not seperated into address, suburb, city etc)

Personal note for Zac, styling to do:
- Form (card) to refer to Profile.jsx
- Need all classNames to be unique - copy and paste, rename to use for each _module.scss
- Label to be purple.
- Responsiveness for ProfileSetUp


Backup plans:
- (Zac - hasn't shared yet) myItems to show only items that are isClaimed=true, not by logged in user's id?
// ------------------------------------------------
// ------------------------------------------------
Monday 19/07/2021

Not all notes written here, but main changes to do:
Orders table obsolete, modify items table for createdById, claimedById to use for hiding items when claimed, and to show on myItems component.

Styling updates - main priorify

Functionality, a lot to do by Rodrigo.

Zac - table routes dbfunction, and then frontend with kris? For reducers etc

Discussion with Don for Auth0
Remove Hashrouter and use BrowserRouter, modify server.js to have the star which sends json. This should be all. Refer to Gardenz

(Also, we have been utilising the kanban board on github for keeping track of our ticket/issues. Thanks for the setup Koko!)

What do we want out of this?
- Fun 
- Learn & practice
- Something "working" 
- Presentable Product 
- Practice Agile method during the project - standups
- Everyone is on the same page, try to minimise any confusion. 
- Keep on communicating.

Roles:
Decision maker?
Guider of group: Kris
Git Master: Zac
Frontend: Kritika, Rodrigo, Zac
Backend: Koko, Kris 
Floater: Rodrigo

Conflicts:
- If tech: democracy, voting.
- If actual conflict: take a 10-min break. Communicate. stop and talk. and utilise standups.  Respect everyon'es space.

Hours:
- Weekdays same for everyone. If working on weekends, prefer to work remotely (commute time is too much)
    Focus on finishing by Friday night, try not to work on the weekends.
    Have a clear plan how far we CAN go or WANT to go.
    Have Sprints everyday.

Communication:
- Slack. Update everyone! especially working in weekends. 

Backlog board:
- Utilise it like the multiday.

When stressed:
- Kris: when he knows what he's doing, quiet time, quiet head space to do work alone. But if blocked, need someone's eyes.
- Zac: Just work alone, quietly. No distractions.
    Note: we could say to everyone "I'm having a time-out" etc.
    Note2: if we need to pair-up, tell everyone/someone and pairup.
- Kritika: Usually go for walk, space, and eat, instrumental music - focus on work alone.
- Rodrigo: Manage it well generally, takes a break in the middle. 
- Koko: Taking a break. Gets stressed when there is nothing to do, needs to be occupied.
    If waiting, to ask if she can help or check backlog.

Standup agenda: 
- Maybe check in like Carolyn - emotions, of how you're feeling
- 3 times a day:
    Once in the morning, and once after lunch time, and before going home.

How will we survive? 
- Eating - be free - mingle with everyone in the cohort.

If you're stuck on something:
- Keep track on how long you're stuck on it. Utilise toggl?
- Usually 15 mins then ask

To do today: 
- Draw out diagrams and components on how its gonna look like.
- Backlog tickets for down/idletime.

Stretch:
- Learn React-native - build on react
- Deploy CICD
- Testing - think about the tests! when writing anything!

// ------------------------------------------------
// Lache's guideline
// ------------------------------------------------

A quick reminder of some of the things you should discuss today :v:
Things to discuss BEFORE planning your project:
- Check in (how are you? How do you feel about working on this larger project?)
- Wellbeing (when I’m stressed ... I need...) (general needs eg. kids, illness, sleep etc)
- Expectation setting and agreements (what hours will we keep (factoring in needing to sustain this for a whole week!), what do we do when conflict arises (create your conflict resolution plan for Human Skills!), how will we communicate)
- How will we work (what roles and what agile rituals will we use etc)
- How will you survive (Will you eat together? How will you break the tension? What is your fun times plan?)
- How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need both technically and non-technically
Things to think of WHILE planning your project and AFTER discussing the things above:
- What is your MVP? How much work do you think it will take to achieve it?
- What tech will you be using? Is there anything you need to research? Will you use Redux?
- GitFlow. How will you arrange your work?
- Roles. Which will you use? Who will be accountable for which areas?
- What might a day look like? What agile rituals will happen? When will you do the hard tech? Will you go outside as a team?
- Documentation. Set up a repo and a readme, start adding things to it
- Set up a kanban board (To Do, Up Next, In Progress, Done)
- Draw your wireframes, make some user stories
Things to remember in general:
To have fun!
